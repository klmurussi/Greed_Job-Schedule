#Think of the houses as n points on a line in that order from left to right
#Hi is a number, the position in miles from the house on the line
H = [H1, H2, H3, H4, ..., Hn]

#And the base stations as some other k points on the same line
#Pj is a number, the position in miles from the base stations on the line
P = []

#A solution is feasible iff every point Hi is with in 4 miles of some point Pj

#Our greedy strategy is to put P1 exactly four miles to the right of H1, remove all houses covered by P1, within 4 miles of P1, and then recursively solve the sub-problem containing the rest of the houses

def bases (H, P):

		return P

		Pj is exctly four miles to the right of H1
		P.append(Pj)
		for i in H:

				remove i from H
